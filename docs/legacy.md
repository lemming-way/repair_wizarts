# Legacy Configuration Files

## webpack.config.js

This project uses **Create React App (CRA)** for build tooling. CRA abstracts away webpack configuration and **ignores custom `webpack.config.js` files** in the root directory.

### What This Means

- The `webpack.config.js` file in the project root **has no runtime effect**
- All webpack configuration is managed internally by `react-scripts`
- To customize webpack, you would need to either:
  - Use `npm run eject` (irreversible, not recommended)
  - Use a tool like `craco` or `react-app-rewired` (adds complexity)
  - Migrate away from CRA entirely (e.g., to Vite, Next.js, or custom webpack)

### Current Status

The `webpack.config.js` file is retained for **reference purposes only** and may contain historical configuration notes. It does not affect the build process.

### Recommendation

Consider either:
1. **Deleting** `webpack.config.js` to avoid confusion
2. **Renaming** it to `webpack.config.legacy.js` to make its non-functional status clear
3. **Adding a comment** at the top of the file explaining it's not used

For any build customization needs, evaluate whether CRA's built-in options (e.g., environment variables, `public/` directory) are sufficient before considering more invasive changes.
